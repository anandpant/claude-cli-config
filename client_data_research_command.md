# Enhanced Manufacturing Intelligence Research Command

Research and compile ULTRA-SPECIFIC data for $ARGUMENTS to create authentic client-specific examples demonstrating intimate knowledge of their manufacturing operations.

## Enhanced Research Protocol:

### 1. ULTRA-SPECIFIC Company Intelligence Gathering
**Target:** $ARGUMENTS (e.g., "LLY insulin PR5", "PFE oncology Pearl River", "MRNA COVID Norwood")

**Critical Details to Find:**
- **Exact facility codes, names, locations** (e.g., "PR5", "Indianapolis North Plant", "Kinsale Site")
- **Internal project names/codes** (e.g., "Project Falcon", "Manufacturing Excellence Initiative", "Lean Six Sigma Black Belt")
- **Specific equipment IDs** (e.g., "BR-101", "Fermenter Tank 205", "Packaging Line Delta")
- **Real investment amounts** ($200M expansion, $1.2B modernization)
- **Actual capacity numbers** (150M units/year, 2,500L bioreactors)
- **Executive names** (VP Manufacturing, Site Directors, Plant Managers)
- **Supplier names** (Cytiva, Merck KGaA, Lonza, Thermo Fisher)
- **Product-specific terminology** (Humalog API, Insulin Lispro, bioreactor campaigns)
- **Regulatory specifics** (21 CFR Part 210/211, ICH Q7, cGMP facility)
- **Company abbreviations** (site codes, division names, internal acronyms)

### 2. Comparative Analysis Against Existing Examples
**Current Examples Review:**
- **DEMO-examples.json Analysis:** Identify generic elements that need real company specifics
- **LLY-examples.json Analysis:** Validate accuracy vs research findings, find missing details
- **Data Structure Requirements:** Ensure research covers all JSON schema elements

### 3. Manufacturing Intelligence Deep Dive
**Research Sources to Exploit:**
- **SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q):** Facility investments, capacity data, specific projects
- **FDA inspection reports/483s:** Site-specific details, compliance issues, facility names
- **Press releases:** Equipment purchases, expansion announcements, investment amounts
- **Investor presentations:** Capacity numbers, production figures, strategic initiatives
- **Patent filings:** Process details, equipment specifications, facility setups
- **LinkedIn:** Executive names, facility-specific roles, internal project references
- **Industry publications:** Equipment vendor case studies, process benchmarks

### 4. Data Structure Mapping (Based on Examples Schema)
**Required Research Coverage:**
- **Meta**: Client name, focus area, version
- **Dashboard Metrics**: OEE, RFT, LAR, CPK with realistic targets
- **Manufacturing**: Equipment (real IDs, types, utilization), production lines, shifts
- **Batches**: Active/completed with realistic batch naming conventions
- **Quality**: Test methods, compliance standards, alert types
- **Supply Chain**: Raw materials, actual suppliers, inventory levels, costs
- **Analytics**: Industry benchmarks, trend predictions, peer rankings
- **Workflows**: Process steps, durations, bottlenecks
- **Case Studies**: Real initiatives with quantified results
- **Integrations**: Actual system names (SAP, LIMS), API endpoints
- **Facilities**: Site details, certifications, environmental controls
